#QUESTION

Following Links in Python

In this assignment you will write a Python program that expands on http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllinks.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags, scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list, follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the name for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment

Sample problem: Start at http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html 
Find the link at position 3 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 4 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
Sequence of names: Fikret Montgomery Mhairade Butchi Anayah 
Last name in sequence: Anayah
Actual problem: Start at: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Rhett.html 
Find the link at position 18 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 7 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
Hint: The first character of the name of the last page that you will load is: S
Strategy
The web pages tweak the height between the links and hide the page after a few seconds to make it difficult for you to do the assignment without writing a Python program. But frankly with a little effort and patience you can overcome these attempts to make it a little harder to complete the assignment without writing a Python program. But that is not the point. The point is to write a clever Python program to solve the program.

Sample execution

Here is a sample execution of a solution:

$ python3 solution.py
Enter URL: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html
Enter count: 4
Enter position: 3
Retrieving: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html
Retrieving: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Montgomery.html
Retrieving: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Mhairade.html
Retrieving: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Butchi.html
Retrieving: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Anayah.html
The answer to the assignment for this execution is "Anayah".
